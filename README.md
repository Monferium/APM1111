STATISTICAL THEORY
> In Statistical Theory, you can expect to encounter a comprehensive and mathematical approach to understanding the principles and foundations of statistics. The course or subject usually covers both theoretical concepts and practical applications, focusing on the development and validation of statistical methods. Below are the key topics and concepts you can expect:
## Probability Theory:
Basic Probability Concepts: Definitions, properties, and theorems of probability, including conditional probability and Bayes' theorem.
Random Variables: Understanding discrete and continuous random variables, probability mass functions (PMFs), probability density functions (PDFs), and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
Expectations and Moments: Calculating expected values, variances, covariances, moments, and moment-generating functions.
Common Distributions: Detailed study of distributions such as Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Exponential, and others.
## Statistical Inference:
Point Estimation: Methods of estimation including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Method of Moments.
Properties of Estimators: Bias, consistency, efficiency, and sufficiency of estimators.
Interval Estimation: Confidence intervals for parameters like means, proportions, and variances.
Hypothesis Testing: Formulation of null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II errors, p-values, power of the test, and common tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests).
Likelihood Ratio Tests: A method of hypothesis testing based on the likelihood function.
## Asymptotic Theory:
Law of Large Numbers (LLN): Understanding the behavior of averages of random variables as the sample size grows.
Central Limit Theorem (CLT): The foundation for why many statistics (like sample means) are approximately normally distributed in large samples.
Asymptotic Properties of Estimators: Discussion of consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators.
## Regression and Statistical Modeling:
Linear Regression: Simple and multiple linear regression, least squares estimation, hypothesis testing in regression, and assumptions of linear regression models.
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): Extensions of linear models, including logistic regression for binary outcomes.
## Bayesian Statistics:
Bayesian Inference: Concepts of prior, likelihood, posterior distributions, and Bayesian updating.
Bayesian Estimation: Comparing Bayesian methods to frequentist methods and their applications in real-world problems.
## Nonparametric Statistics:
Rank-Based Methods: Methods like the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the sign test, which don't assume a specific distribution.
Kernel Density Estimation: Estimating the probability density function of a random variable in a nonparametric way.
## Sampling Theory:
Sampling Distributions: Understanding the distribution of sample statistics.
Bootstrap Methods: Resampling techniques used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic.
## Multivariate Statistics:
Multivariate Distributions: Joint distributions of multiple random variables.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction techniques.
Factor Analysis: Identifying underlying relationships between variables.
## Statistical Decision Theory:
Decision Rules: Formulating decision rules under uncertainty.
Risk Functions: Analyzing the expected loss of a decision rule.
Bayes Decision Rule: Minimizing expected loss in Bayesian decision-making.
## Computational Statistics:
Monte Carlo Methods: Techniques for numerical integration and simulation, often used in Bayesian statistics.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Algorithms for sampling from complex distributions.
